संरक्षण: An Endangered Birds Recognition Portal

Home to around 11,000 species of fauna, Nepal is a country rich in biodiversity. Among
them about 900 species are birds. Due to various reasons like encroachment of their nat-
ural habitats, and rampage killing many of these species are facing the threat of extinc-
tion. Around 38 endangered birds in Nepal need conservation. The growing advance-
ment in machine learning can support the preservation of those species and monitoring
the status of birds in the ecosystem can assist researchers of Nepal’s biodiversity in
planning different strategies for their preservation. We propose an endangered birds
classification system to identify bird calls from the audio data-set collected from Xeno-
canto.org. This could be achieved by converting the time-domain audio data signal to
time and frequency domain signal with wavelet transform, generating the scalograms
and feeding it to the deep learning model architecture like efficientNet which is based
on a convolutional neural network. A genetic algorithm can be used for parameter optimization.
